    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This delta pick and place was developed as a prototype to showcase the speed and agility of delta robot, with the
        aid of object detection using OpenCv library to detect and locate objects, then send their locations to the
        robot to go pick them up and move them to a desired location. During the development of robot we need a way to
        send commands to do certain actions to facilitate calibrating the mechanical design with the software using
        forward and inverse kinematics hence the need for a controller desktop application and all the functionality of
        the app.</p>
    <h2>Qt app</h2>
    <p>The application was developed to help with the control of the delta robot from any desktop PC/Laptop to
        facilitate the development and control of the project.</p>
    <h2>Why did we choose Qt framework?</h2>
    <p>we chose Qt framework because it has a very good-looking UI and links the UI Elements with the backbone code that
        runs the application from handling the serial communication to doing the image processing of detecting objects
        (using OpenCV) available to be picked up.</p>
